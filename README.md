# breakitdown
An app that breaks down projects and tasks into manageable steps.

# Getting Started

Run npm i from client & server folders to run. You will have to have an API key from OpenAI's API platform to use the AI functionality. The app also works without it, the user just has to add their own tasks.

# Teck stack

NodeJS & Express for the backend, React & Tailwind for the frontend & MongoDB & Mongoose for the database. The AI functionality comes from OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 turbo-instruct model.
